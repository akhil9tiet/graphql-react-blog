# react-graphql blog

All the code in this repo is not mine. It is directly the result of what i am learning from this course on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_

The original code is by # Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller @maxschwarzmueller

The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/academind/yt-graphql-react-event-booking-api

I am very thankful to him for making this repo commonly available. He is a great inspiratrion for me.

In no way I wish to pass this code as my own.
